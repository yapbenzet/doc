================
apt-get install devscripts
apt-get install quilt


(http://cs-people.bu.edu/doucette/xia/guides/debian-patch.txt)

The quilt patch system manages a stack of patches to the original source.
Since we want to add a new patch, we must first apply all patches contained
in the package.

  $ export QUILT_PATCHES=debian/patches
  $ quilt push -a
  File series fully applied, ends at patch 16_licence_about_location.patch

Now we can create our patch. We'll prefix with with "17_" since the last
patch in debian/patches is prefixed with "16_".

  $ quilt new 17_readme.patch
  Patch 17_readme.patch is now on top
  $ quilt add README          # do this for every file you edit
  File README added to patch 17_readme.patch
  $ echo 'This wireshark has XIA support' >> README
  $ quilt refresh
  Refreshed patch 17_readme.patch
  $ quilt pop -a

You can now build the package, but first you need to install its build dependencies.

  # apt-get build-dep wireshark

If you decide to rename the package (say, to "wireshark-xia"), you must do so
in two places: first, add a new entry to the debian/changelog file (be sure
to respect the indentation; it must be exactly the same as in the other
entries). In your entry, instead of using "wireshark" as the package name
in the first line of the changelog entry, change it to "wireshark-xia". The
changelog can be edited by using the dch utility. To add a new entry to the
changelog, issue:

  $ dch -i

Here you can rename the package, change the version, add in your name/email
address, and provide a synopsis of changes made.

!!! eger paketin adi degisirse debian/paketadi.install gibi dosyalari da
    degistirmek gerek

Second, edit the debian/control file and change the "Source:" header to
"wireshark-xia" and change the "Package:" headers to add the new name. For
example, change "Package: wireshark-common" to "Package: wireshark-xia-common".
Note that some libraries are also built from this package (eg. libwireshark1,
libwiretap1). If you rename those too, be sure to replace the old name globally
in the control file, because some of the packages depend on those libraries,
and the name listed in the "Depends:" header must match with the one declared
in the "Package:" header. If you do change the package naming scheme, you will
have to change the name of the original tarball in order to execute the debuild
step.

Finally, you can now generate the debian package:

  # apt-get install devscripts
  $ debuild -uc -us
